# URLShortener
Built a URL shortener that used MongoDB for the backend that keeps track of the shortened version of the URL and also the number of clicks on the shortened version. 
The short URL is generated using a JavaScript library called ShortID. 
The UI consists of EJS for the main framework of the app and the styling was with CSS3 and Bootstrap.
